title: Top 10 Quants Ranked by Google Search
---


Let's find the top 10 quants ranked by Google. We start with a list of quants on Wikipedia and then google their name with additional key word "quant". Then they are ranked by number of results returned by google search.


```python
from selenium import webdriver 
import time
```


```python
# Define Chrome options to open the window in maximized mode
options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
options.add_argument("--start-maximized")

# Initialize the Chrome webdriver and open the URL
driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)
listurl= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_quantitative_analysts"
driver.get(listurl)
```


```python
quantelems=driver.find_elements_by_xpath('//*[@id="mw-content-text"]/div/ul/li/a[1]')
quantnames = []
for quantelem in quantelems:
    quantnames.append(quantelem.text)
```


```python
googlecounts=[]
for quantname in quantnames:
    driver.get("https://www.google.com/search?q="+quantname+" quant")
    elem = driver.find_element_by_id("resultStats")
    googlecount_str = elem.text[:-15]
    googlecount=googlecount_str.replace(',', '')
    googlecount = [int(i) for i in googlecount.split() if i.isdigit()] 
    googlecounts.append(googlecount[0])
    print(quantname + " " + googlecount_str)
    time.sleep(2)
    
```

# Conclusion 
It turns out that quants with more common names tend to be ranked higher. A more elaborated ranking sceheme is needed and will be the focus of future work. See also a [video](https://youtu.be/rQHopF7f5rM) generated from this project.
